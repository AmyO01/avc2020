Sweet. 

# Plan (Rough idea)

By 11 of June we want at least the core code complete with progress on the completion.
 During this time we hope to have a few meetings (in some shape or form), working on any bugs we have, further plan the next week, keeping up to date/track of what is in the report progress. We also plan on having a meeting soon that will allow us to create a more detailed plan as we have had trouble communicating. In the second week we plan on having completion done and either working on Challenge or fixing problems in the code or cleaning the code. We will also be keeping up with the team report and individual reports.
